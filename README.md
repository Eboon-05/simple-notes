# ðŸ’€ Simple notes

A dead simple notes taker. Made using Lit, Redux, Typescript, Vite, Sass, Animate.css and [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).

## Scripts

- `dev`: Start the development server.
- `build`: Make the production build.
- `lint`: Run eslint.
- `serve`: Serve the dist folder using `http-server-spa`.

## PWA testing

You will need many terminal tabs.

1. Run npm run build for making the build. You will have to re-run on every change.
2. Use the npm run serve for serving the dist folder.
3. In my case, I use ngrok for making the page https for testing on mobile.
